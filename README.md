# Pose-Detection-and-Repetition-counter
Our project uses Mediapipe for real-time pose estimation and OpenCV for video capture to count exercise repetitions accurately. It tracks key body landmarks, analyzes movement patterns, and provides instant feedback to ensure proper form. Adaptable for various exercises, it enhances fitness tracking and reduces injury risk.
